            <h2 class="secHeading">ADVENTURE TIME</h2>
            <p class="text">An adventure is an exciting experience or undertaking that is typically bold, sometimes risky. Adventures may be activities with danger such as traveling, exploring, skydiving, mountain climbing, scuba diving, river rafting, or other extreme sports.
                <br><br>
                Adventure sports or extreme sports are activities undertaken through the medium of Land, Water and Air and perceived as involving a high degree of risk. These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion and highly specialized gear. Details of adventure sports popular in the world are:

            </div>
            <p class="text">Mountain biking or MTB is an off-road bicycle racing sport that is usually set on rough terrain like mountain, desert, or rocks with specially designed mountain bikes. Professional riders compete on various locations throughout the world while trying to stay on their bikes. Specially modified bikes for off-road usage have been around since the late 19th century and its first modern world competition took place in 1950. Mountain biking is also a popular recreational activity in various parts of the world. 
                <br><br>
                If you are new to mountain biking, picking the right bike for yourself can be a complicated business. There are different bikes are available for every type of rider and terrain. You should visit a local bike shop that specializes in mountain bikes to learn about mountain bike types and also to find a fitting bike for yourself.

            </div>
            <p class="text">paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. Unlike hang gliders, their close relations, paragliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect.
                <br><br>
                The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and controls the wing via lines attached to the trailing edge of the paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the paraglider or simultaneously to influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and landing are on foot and usually occur on a hill or mountain. To launch, the pilot first inflates the wing by pulling it up like a kite and then runs down the hillside until flying speed has been reached. Usually a speed of about 12 miles per hour (19 km per hour) is enough to launch the craft. Paragliders may also be launched from flatland by towing, either with a winch or behind a vehicle.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.
